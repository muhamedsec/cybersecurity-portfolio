# Course 3: Network Security (Modules 1-2)

This part of the course introduced fundamental concepts of network architecture, protocols, and early security tools.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Basics of network layers and protocols: TCP/IP, UDP, and DNS  
- Understanding how data moves through networks  
- Introduction to firewalls and their role in filtering traffic  
- Overview of common network threats and vulnerabilities

## 💡 Insights
Learning how networks work helped me see why network security is critical. Firewalls and filters act as the first line of defense to protect systems from unauthorized access.

## 🛠️ Tools Practiced
- Basic packet inspection concepts (prepping to use tools like Wireshark)  
- Awareness of network scanning methods (to be explored in depth later)

## 📌 Why It Matters
A solid grasp of network fundamentals is essential before diving into advanced monitoring and defense techniques.

## 🚀 Next Steps
Continue with hands-on labs focusing on network scanning, packet capture, and intrusion detection systems.
