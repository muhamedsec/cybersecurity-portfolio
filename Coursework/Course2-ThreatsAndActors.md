# Course 2: Threats and Threat Actors

This module introduced different types of threat actors, attack methods, and how attackers exploit vulnerabilities.

## 👥 Types of Threat Actors
- Script kiddies: amateur hackers using existing tools  
- Nation-state actors: government-backed groups targeting espionage or disruption  
- Hacktivists: politically or socially motivated hackers  
- Insider threats: employees or contractors misusing access

## 🧠 What I Learned
Cybersecurity involves understanding **who** might attack and **why**. Attackers’ motives and skills shape their tactics, so defense strategies must adapt accordingly.

## 🛠️ Tools & Concepts
- Social engineering techniques: phishing, baiting, pretexting  
- Malware categories: viruses, worms, ransomware  
- Attack surfaces & attack vectors

## 📌 Why It Matters
Recognizing threat actors and their methods helps prioritize defenses and tailor security policies to real risks.

## 🚀 Next Steps
Plan to explore social engineering defenses and malware analysis in upcoming labs and projects.
