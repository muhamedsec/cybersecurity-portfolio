# Course 1: Foundations of Cybersecurity

This summary captures the key concepts and lessons I learned from the first course in my cybersecurity journey.

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **CIA Triad:** Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability  
- Difference between **Cybersecurity** and **Information Security**  
- Core cybersecurity roles: analyst, engineer, CISO, etc.  
- Importance of **risk management**

## 🧠 What I Learned
This course helped me understand what cybersecurity is really about — not just stopping hackers, but protecting systems and data in every environment. I learned that not every threat is technical — it could be human error or poor policy too.

## 🛠️ Tools/Terms I Learned
- Authentication vs Authorization  
- MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)  
- Threat, Vulnerability, Risk

## 📌 Why It Matters
The fundamentals are essential — everything else I do (labs, bug hunting, tools) builds on this.

## 🚀 Next Steps
I plan to deepen my understanding of network security and apply these concepts in hands-on labs and real-world projects.
